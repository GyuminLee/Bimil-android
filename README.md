# Bimil-android

Bimil, safe way to remember password. <br />
Bimil means the secret in Korean. <br />
This app is used to remember password by some hints.<br />
Many websites have different password requirements such as combination of number, capital letter, special character.<br />
Usually we forgot what they required and always find password again and again.<br />
The user may use specific password based on their requirements.<br />
Therefore, this app helps to remind the requirements at the website.<br />
Note that, Bimil doesn't require the password. <br />
