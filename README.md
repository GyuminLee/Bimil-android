# Bimil-android
Bimil, safe way to remember password.
Bimil means secret in Korean. 
This app is used to remember password by some hints.
Many websites have different password requirements such as combination of number, capital letter, special character.
Usually we forgot what they required and always find password again and again.
The user may use specific password based on their requirements.
Therefore, this app helps to remind the requirements at the website.
Note that, Bimil doesn't require the password.
